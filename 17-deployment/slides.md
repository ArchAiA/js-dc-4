### Monolithic Applications

Single-tiered software applications
User interface and data access code are combined into a single program

### Microservices

Used to build flexible, independently deployable software systems

### Containers

Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that offer:

Environmental Consistency
Operational Efficiency
Developer Productivity
Version Control

## Docker

Images
Containers
Docker Daemon
Docker Client
Docker Hub

## Let's Practice Using Docker


## Deployment

--
### Deploying Static Applications

--
### Static applications/websites
- all html, css and js is already generated (static)
- can then be delivered as is

--
### Application Architecture
