# Pokedex

We've been contracted by Professor Elm to build an online version of the Pokedex, the palm pilot looking thing that has all of the information about every Pokemon in it.

Our web application should have a home page that lists every pokemon in order. Each pokemon should be a link to a page that shows all the details about that pokemon.

Our application will need a server running express, at least 2 views and 1 layout using handlebars and probably 2+ routes.

As a bonus
