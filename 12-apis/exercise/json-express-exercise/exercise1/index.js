// 1. Create a route to return all of the quotes in our array



// 2. Retrive a random quote by adding a new route '/quote/random' then calculate a random index, grab the quote and return it

// 3: Add the ability to grab a single quote. The way you do this is by adding a ":param" to the route, so the route will look like "/quote/:id" and the id will be available using req.params.


BONUS:
// 4: Add a POST method to add your own quote - We will need to create a special view and submit method in order to create this request

// 5: Add the ability to DELETE a post - We will need to create a special view and submit method in order to create this request
