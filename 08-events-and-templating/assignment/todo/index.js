/*

To do - with templates!

We're going to refactor our simple to do list application to use handlebars teplates

This one you'll have free reign to go as far as you want.

The minumum requirement is that you use one handlebars template, compile it and add it to the page and that your to do list updates when a user submits the form.

A good starting point would be to build out the to do list as a template, that is recompiled and rerendered in your form's submit event handler.

After that, you could break out your single to do list template into a to do list template that renders a template for each to do item. For that, you'll have to research partials
